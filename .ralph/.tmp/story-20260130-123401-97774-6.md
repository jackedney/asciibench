### US-006: Create Judge UI FastAPI app skeleton with HTMX
Status: in_progress
Depends on: US-002, US-003

Description:
As a developer, I want a FastAPI app skeleton with HTMX so that the double-blind comparison interface can be built later.

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Create asciibench/judge_ui/main.py with FastAPI app instance
- [ ] Add root route '/' returning welcome HTML page
- [ ] Add '/judge' route returning comparison HTML skeleton
- [ ] Add POST '/api/votes' route accepting Vote model (placeholder logic)
- [ ] Create templates/base.html with HTMX CDN script included
- [ ] Create templates/judge.html with placeholder comparison layout
- [ ] Add triple-font CSS styles: .font-classic (Courier New), .font-modern (Consolas), .font-condensed (Fira Code)
- [ ] Example: GET '/' returns HTML with title 'ASCIIBench Judge UI'
- [ ] Negative case: POST to '/api/votes' without body -> returns 422 validation error
- [ ] Run `uv run uvicorn asciibench.judge_ui.main:app` and visit localhost:8000 successfully
- [ ] Run `uv run ty check` with no errors
