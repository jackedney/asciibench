### US-008: Configure quality gates (pytest, ruff, ty)
Status: in_progress
Depends on: US-002

Description:
As a developer, I want configured quality gates so that code quality and type safety are enforced automatically.

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Create pytest.ini with test discovery settings and coverage target 80%
- [ ] Create pyproject.toml [tool.ruff] section with line-length=100, target-version='py312'
- [ ] Create pyproject.toml [tool.ruff.lint] section with enabled rules (E, F, I, N, W, UP, B, C4, PT, RUF)
- [ ] Create pyproject.toml [tool.ruff.format] section with quote-style='double', indent-style='space'
- [ ] Create pyproject.toml [tool.ty] section with config for type checking
- [ ] Create tests/test_models.py with sample tests for pydantic models
- [ ] Example: pytest runs and discovers all tests in tests/
- [ ] Negative case: code with unused variable -> ruff reports warning
- [ ] Example: code with type mismatch -> ty check reports error
- [ ] Run `uv run pytest --cov` and see coverage report
- [ ] Run `uv run ruff check` on entire codebase
- [ ] Run `uv run ruff format --check` to verify formatting
- [ ] Run `uv run ty check` to verify type safety
